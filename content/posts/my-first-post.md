So, here we go. This is my first ever post written on the wild-wild internet.
I hope this thing will work kinda like an IG works when you install it on your phone and you suddenly feel like you need to post some photos once in a while. 

This is a first post in a series and here I am willing to commit to write a simple yet future rich enough console task manager in Java. Why bother doing this stupid stuff? Because I am lazy to do something more sophisticated, but at the same time I want to learn a couple of other programming languages and I need something to do. My first attempt on learning Haskell clearly has shown me that simply reading a book and copy-pasting (even if actually re-typing) examples doesn't do it for me.

So the idea is to come up with a solid, working application which has some stuff in it, but still is relatively easy to write from scratch in other languane within feasible timeframe. 

And off we go. Wish me a luck and some time.
