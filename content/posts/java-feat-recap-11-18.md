It's been a couple days since the GA release of Java 18, so why don't we celebrate it with yet another recap of the features that one might miss if they still work with version 11 (like I do ðŸ¥²). This is an opinionated list of features, mostly user-facing ones that are quite nice and could be used to convince you colleagues to move to a newer version of Java.
