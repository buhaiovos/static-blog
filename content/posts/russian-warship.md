On Feb 24th Russia announced a war against Ukraine. 

Don't even try to kid yourself - there is no special operation, denazification - any of that stuff. Instead, there's a brutal attempt to wipe out a whole naiton that takes place in the heart of European continent, just because our world view is different from theirs. I belive that all responsible people will be punished and there will be justice. Simply becuause you can't hide the truth this days. Hopefully this happens sooner than later.

Glory to Ukraine, glory to Ukrainian Armed Forces and glory to our amazing people who stand strong for more than a month and will continue to stand till our victory ðŸ’ªðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦.
